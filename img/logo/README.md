The logo has been created with InkScape, starting from the [original PSF logo files](psf_official_logo_files/) and removing all unnecessary layers.

The colors of the two snakes are orange “Sevilla” #ffab60 (with gradient to #f8dabf) and the green of the provincial flag #007749 (with gradient to #8ebaa0).

The font used is “Justa” taken from the [Justa y Rvfina project](https://justayrvfina.com/), and are attached in a [JustayRvfina.zip](JustayRvfina.zip).
